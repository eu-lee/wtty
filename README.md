## What this fork adds

A macOS-native **git worktree sidebar**. Each window can list the worktrees of
the repository its terminal is in and switch the whole window between
per-worktree workspaces. Worktrees are resolved from the window's working
directory.

A *workspace* is the window's entire split layout — switching swaps every pane
at once, and the workspace you leave keeps running in the background: processes,
scrollback, and layout all survive, and switching back restores them exactly.

The sidebar header shows `root: <path>` — the directory the worktrees link to
(the main worktree), which stays fixed no matter which worktree you're on. The
**main worktree is pinned to the top**; the worktree the window is currently
switched to is marked with a leading `*`. Worktrees with a live session
("active") are grouped above the inactive ones, and any worktree whose session
has rung its bell shows a bell indicator on its row.

### Keybinds

All bindings below are macOS-only; the actions are no-ops elsewhere. Defaults
are compiled into this fork's build (see `src/config/Config.zig`); the cycle
actions ship unbound so you can bind them yourself.

| Action | Default bind | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `toggle_worktree_sidebar` | `cmd+shift+e` | Show or hide the worktree sidebar. |
| `worktree_picker` | `cmd+opt+n` | Open the worktree palette (press again, or `esc`, to close it). |
| `goto_worktree:next` | _(unbound)_ | Switch to the next active worktree. |
| `goto_worktree:previous` | _(unbound)_ | Switch to the previous active worktree. |
| `close_worktree_session` | `cmd+opt+c` | Tear down the selected worktree's live session, leaving the worktree on disk. |
| `remove_worktree` | `cmd+opt+backspace` | `git worktree remove` the selected worktree (branch left intact). |

To bind the unbound actions, add them to your Ghostty config, e.g.:

```ini
keybind = cmd+alt+right_bracket=goto_worktree:next
keybind = cmd+alt+left_bracket=goto_worktree:previous
```

### Using it

- **Open the sidebar** with `cmd+shift+e` or View → Worktree Sidebar.
- **Switch, open, or create** with the palette (`cmd+opt+n`, also reachable via
  View → Go to Worktree…). It's one search bar, sectioned:
  - **Worktrees** — live worktrees; choosing one switches to it.
  - **Branches** — local branches with no worktree; choosing one runs
    `git worktree add ../<repo>-worktrees/<branch> <branch>` and opens it.
  - **Remote branches** — fetched remote branches with no local counterpart,
    most recently committed first; choosing one runs
    `git worktree add ../<repo>-worktrees/<branch> -b <branch> <remote>/<branch>`,
    creating the local branch (tracking the remote) and its worktree in one
    step. Only the 20 most recent are listed until you type; searching reaches
    all of them. This section never fetches — it lists what your last `git
    fetch` already brought down.
  - **Create branch '<query>'** — shown when your query matches nothing; runs
    `git worktree add ../<repo>-worktrees/<branch> -b <branch> <base>` using the
    selected worktree's branch as the default base (or repository HEAD if none
    is selected).

  Worktrees live in a visible container directory next to the repository, one
  subdirectory per branch (slashes become dashes). Git errors show inline in
  the palette, never as alerts.
- **Close a session** with `close_worktree_session` (`cmd+opt+c`) or a row's
  right-click **Close Session**. This drops the worktree's live workspace and
  returns the row to inactive; the worktree stays on disk, and opening it again
  starts a fresh session.
- **Remove a worktree** with `remove_worktree` (`cmd+opt+backspace`) or a row's
  right-click **Remove Worktree…**, which runs `git worktree remove` for that
  checkout. The branch is left intact. If git refuses because the worktree is
  dirty, the sidebar shows the error inline and offers **Force remove**.

The keybind actions act on the sidebar's currently selected worktree, whether or
not the sidebar is showing. Removal is refused for the main worktree, and
closing a worktree with no live session is a no-op. The sidebar's collapsed
state and width are remembered for the app session (new windows inherit them);
persisting across restarts, and dirty / ahead-behind indicators, are non-goals
for v1. Creation and removal never delete branches.

### How to build

Build optimized — this emits the **ReleaseLocal** configuration, which is
ad-hoc code-signed with no notarization or auto-update (the right trade-off for
a personal fork):

```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

Produces `macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Wtty.app`; copy it into `/Applications`
(use `ditto` rather than `cp -R` so signing metadata is preserved):

```sh
ditto macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Wtty.app /Applications/Wtty.app
```
Because it isn't notarized, Gatekeeper will complain on first launch — either
right-click → **Open** once, or clear the quarantine flag:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Wtty.app
```

There's no auto-update, so re-run the build after you pull. The full, notarized
`Release` pipeline (Developer ID signing + Sparkle appcast) is upstream's
distribution path and needs an Apple Developer account — out of scope for this
fork.

> **Note on identity.** Wtty ships under its own bundle id (`com.eulee.wtty`),
> name, and app icon, but keeps the `ghostty` executable name so the CLI and
> config (`~/.config/ghostty`) are unchanged.

## Upstream

Everything not described above is upstream Ghostty — a fast, native,
feature-rich terminal emulator. For the full story, downloads, and
documentation see [ghostty.org](https://ghostty.org) and
[ghostty-org/ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty). Wtty is an
independent personal fork and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Ghostty
project.
